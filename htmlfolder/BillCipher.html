<h2 id="what_he_is">Number One:What he is</h2>
<p>Bill is an ancient demon who's older than the galaxy and far greater than other nightmare beings. </p>
<h2 id="what_he_looks_like">Number Two:His physical apperance</h2>
<p>Bill is a triangle with a pyramid design, therefore resembling the Illuminati symbol or the Eye of Providence, with an eye in the middle. Among the bottom part of his body is a brick pattern. In the theme song, Bill has a top hat on, a bow tie, and stick arms and legs.As a dream demon, Bill is capable of altering his body into a variety of frightening and cubic forms. While he can manipulate his own body at will, wounds on Bill seems to suggest his inside has an organic, flesh-like texture. This is hinted at in the Journal 3, where it says, that his outer layer is an exoskeleton that in order to eat he has to remove.</p>
<h2 id="His_personality">Number Three:His personality.</h2>
<p>Bill is a master manipulator able to adapt, manipulate, and deceive others through the use of flattery, promises, mind control, or dealings throughout making himself and his objective a mystery. Despite his insane and sadistic ways, Bill is friendly, if not obnoxious, to others, but this is only one of the many acts he puts on; he is willing to betray, lie, and submit others to a life of misery and torment for his own amusement and shamelessly go back on his deals (while technically keeping his promise) through his word lineage and manner of phrases.<br>At times, Bill has a murderous temper and it causes his voice to become deep and his apperance to change. He also appears to be aware of his insanity, as when Gideon states him as such, he shrugs it off, asking what his point was.<br>
Bill also has a weird and sadistic sense of humor. This is seen during his maniacal laughter in the face of other people's and his own pain, such as taking teeth out of a deer and presenting it as a gift to Gideon, switching around every orfice on Northwest's face and, after taking control of Dipper's body, describing pain as "hilarious" while continuously self-harming, showing he also takes pleasure in his own pain. This doesn't explain why the Axolotl said, "says he's happy; he's a liar," in the poem stated in the pirates' treasure novel. It could possibly mean that his twisted sense of humor is just an act that he uses to take his mind off the fact that he destroyed his family and dimension . Or he enjoys watching others feel the pain that he had carried for billions of years and counting. Either way, Bill does have some sort of guilt towards destroying his home(But he'll never admit it). Despite his treacherous nature, Bill does have a twisted sense of honor. He will follow through on deals and keep his word, assuming if he's in the mood for it but strongly prefers the immoral way and feels no motive or debt for anything. Without good reason, he allowed Gideon control over Gravity Falls after he took a physical form and control of the world. Outside of this, Bill displayed a willingness to go against his own rules, preparing to invade Ford's mind without his consent, before being reminded that he cannot do that without engaging a deal with the person. He is not above torture or blackmail to obtain what he wants such as attempting to force Ford to accept his deal through intimidation and threatening to murder Dipper and Mabel if he did not consent. Ironically, Bill's backstabbing ways left him oblivious to a double-cross from the Pines twins, resulting in his defeat.<br>

Despite his confident nature, if Bill gets caught in a helpless situation, he'll go into a deep panic, as when Bill was tricked into entering Stan's mind and was about to be erased from existence, Bill desperately tried to bargain with Stan by offering to give him money, fame, riches, infinite power, and even his own galaxy.

<h2 id="His_past">Number four:His past</h2>
<p>Bill Cipher's past is long and extensive and if you wanted to find out the most about it, I suggest you check out Journal 3. Bill once lived in the Second Dimension, a place that he soon destroyed and described as a "flat world with flat minds and flat ideas." Bill then became determined of spreading chaos and destruction, which forced him to "liberate" his dimension by destroying everything there, including his own parents. Eventually, he found his way to the Nightmare Realm where Bill soon met up with the Henchmaniacs. In this dimension, Bill had no corporeal form, so he could only access or possess the minds of humans. With this ability, Bill manipulated countless humans so that he could find a way to enter the Third Dimension, then gain a physical form and liberate that dimension as well.
As trillions of years passed, Bill's interactions were recorded throughout the history of humanity. At one point in time, he met the natives who lived in what would become Gravity Falls, Oregon. The people discovered that Bill was too dangerous and found a way to defeat him using a zodiac with ten different symbols. The people left behind a painting depicting their encounter with the demon, instructions on how to summon him, and a warning to never read it. Stanford Pines would discover this symbol in the late twentieth century when he came to investigate the town, hoping that it would help him in his research on Gravity Falls' anomalies. After a failed attempt to summon the entity, Ford ended up encountering Bill in his dreams, where he offered to help with the answer to Ford's questions of the universe and gain his trust. Ford was blinded by this flattery when he agreed to the deal.

Bill then had Ford build a machine that he claimed would benefit mankind, but in reality, it was a portal for the demon to enter the 3rd Dimension. However, one of Ford's human friends, Fiddleford McGucket, discovered the true nature of the portal and warned Ford before completing their project. Horrified and betrayed, Ford shut down the project and hid all three journals on how to operate it, shifting to working on countermeasures in case the demon ever returned. Bill, however, patiently boded his time for the portal to reactivate.</p>


<h2 id="His_abilities">Number five:His abilities</h2>
<p>Immortality: Bill is older than the galaxy.<br>
Knowing Everything: Bill possesses knowledge of many things in existence. He does not,however, know everything as he has been tricked multiple times in the past.<br>
Deals/contracts: One of Bill's most noticeable abilities is that he can make a contract with someone to give the said person who made a deal with him fame, power, or a request. Bill's hand becomes surrounded in a blue flame and, once the person exchanges a handshake, while the flame doesn't harm the person, the deal will be sealed. However, once the deal is sealed, Bill will want something in return that often ends up in his twisted methods. If the person breaks the deal, Bill's powers won't have any effects on them. Also, making deals is the only way Bill's powers could have an effect but only to the ones who made a deal with him.<br>
Dream Walking: Living up to being called the "Dream Demon", as Bill makes a deal with someone, he can enter their dreams. He entered Stan Pines' mind to get the combination to the safe after making a deal with Gideon.<br>
Possession: Another way if someone makes a deal with someone, Bill can possess a host who made a deal with him. While in the host's body, their eyes turn into Bill's.<br>
Levitation: Bill can hover and float freely.<br>
Reality Manipulation: Another one of Bill's most noticeable traits is his power to manipulate the laws of reality. Bill can transform organic matter, disorient the physical world, and cause a ripple in the space-time continuum. After breaking the Nightmare Realm, Bill's powers grew stronger to the point where he can manipulate reality on a cosmic scale.<br>
Regeneration: Bill can repair himself if he gets injured, such as his form, his limbs, and his eye. However, he stated it takes an hour for his eye to regrow.<br>
Shape-Shifting: Bill can switch his form between 2D to 3D. He can even change into a demonic form with spider-like traits.Bill can grow into an enormous or gigantic size and can return to his normal size at will. He is able to increase the size of his body parts as he did with his fist.<br
Telekinesis: Bill can lift and move objects and living beings with his mind.<br>
Telepathy: Bill can read a person's thoughts.<br>
Soul Removal: Bill can remove a person's soul from their bodies, as he removed Dipper's soul from his body so he could possess it.<br>
Body Projection:Bill can remove himself from his physical form to enter the mindscape and his physical form will become stone.<br>

<h2>FUN FACTS!</h2>
<ol>
<li class="non-link-list">Contrary to popular belief, Bill Cipher cannot be identified as male or female, as he is a being above the concept of gender or race. He also claims his home dimension has 14 billion different gender identities and there is paperwork involved in determining your gender and he's not exactly been keeping track of his. Whether this is true or him just lying to seem impressive however is unclear.</li>
<li class="non-link-list">His name is a combination of Bill, referring to the Eye of Providence which appears on dollar bills, and cipher, which is the algorithm for encryption or decryption.It may also be a reference to the names Lou Cipher (Lucifer) and Bill Zeebub (Beelzebub), which are common nicknames for Satan.</li>
<li class="non-link-list">(None of this is real and only applies to the show.)Bill had several influences over history:
When the ancient Egyptians attempted to create a portal for Bill, it only worked for ten minutes letting out a jackal-headed man from the Nightmare Realm. Bill was furious. He tormented them with nightmares, and they built giant stone tributes to Bill, hoping to make them stop. (The arms and top hats of these structures broke off over time.)
Bill gave George Washington the secrets that helped him defeat the British. But when George's attempt at a steam-powered portal sank into a swamp, Bill gave Washington such bad nightmares that he ground his teeth into dust in his sleep and then had to get wooden ones. Washington put Bill on the one-dollar bill in order to appease him.
Bill helped Stanley Kubrick fake the US moon landing, hoping that, in return, Kubrick would convince NASA to build a functioning portal. When NASA rejected the proposal, Bill cursed Kubrick with bizarre nightmares, which, in an ironic twist, ended up helping him in his film career.</li>
