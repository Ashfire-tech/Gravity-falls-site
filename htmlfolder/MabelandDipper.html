<h2 id="Who-he-is-Dipper">Number One:Who he is</h2>
<p>Mason "Dipper" Pines (born August 31, 5 minutes after Mabel Pines) is a smart, curious, and adventurous 12-year-old boy spending the summer with his Great Uncle Stan in Gravity Falls, Oregon, where he and his sister constantly encounter the town's paranormal tendencies. Armed with a mysterious journal he found in a hidden place in a tree in the forest, he is the overall main protagonist of Gravity Falls and he seeks to uncover the town's mysterious secrets. Dipper is represented by the pine tree in the Zodiac used to banish Bill Cipher.
</p>
<h2 id="What-he-looks-like-Dipper">Number two:His physical apperance</h2>
<p>Dipper is sometimes seen with a green backpack. He has a birthmark on his forehead shaped like the constellation, the Big Dipper, hence his nickname "Dipper," which he hides under his bangs. He is exactly one millimetre shorter than his sister, Mabel Pines, however, he grows taller than her throughout the show. His only other clothes apart from his normal outfit seen on the show are the hat he arrived in Gravity Falls with, his lamb costume in "The Inconveniencing," the peanut butter costume he wore in "Summerween," the wolf costume that Grunkle Stan made Dipper wear for an attraction at the Mystery Shack and, later, his tourist guide clothes in "Boss Mabel," the white shirt, red swimsuit and red and white hat he wore as a lifeguard uniform in "The Deep End," a v-neck and full-length black pants he wore for the Woodstick Festival in "The Love God," and a tuxedo in "Northwest Mansion Mystery." As of "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls," he receives and wears Wendy's lumberjack hat.

His nightwear or comfortable outfit for hanging around the Mystery Shack is the same as his regular outfit, but without his hat, vest or shoes.</p>
<h2 id="His-personality-Dipper">Number Three:His personality</h2>
<p>Intelligent, compassionate, self-conscious and rational, and sometimes, overly judgmental, Dipper Pines can't wait to leave adolescence in the rear-view mirror. A born adventurer at heart, Dipper can't sit still and is always looking for the next riddle to solve. His careful attention to detail comes in handy when he is off figuring out the mystery of the day, but sometimes his over-zealousness leaves others questioning his credibility.His refusal to sit still when there are puzzles to be solved often leaves him restless in everyday situations.He has a habit of clicking his pen repeatedly when in deep thought. He also seems to get very irritated when people think he's cute or adorable, as he wants to be taken seriously as a grown-up from people around him as at most times Dipper is more mature and wiser than others.When Dipper and Mabel (and Soos at times) are on their adventures Dipper is the one to act as the leader mostly because he is shown to be very brave and smart. He is somewhat protective of his sister, whenever she is in danger he is always there to help and will do anything to get her free.

He can sometimes be selfish and is not above using Gravity Falls' mysterious elements to his advantage. He can also be ruthless in the pursuit of his goals.But he always does the right thing and has the right motivations. It is also well mentioned that Dipper is paranoid and has had trust issues since the beginning when the journal warned him to "Trust No One" and has been skeptical about people and situations.</p> 
<h2 id="His-past-Dipper">Number four:His past</h2>
<p>Dipper was born on August 31.His family lives in Piedmont, California. At a young age, Dipper's mother would dress him up in a lamb costume and have him perform his signature song and dance, the "Lamby Lamby Dance."He and Mabel were raised nonreligious, but celebrate all holidays at his sister's insistence.Since he was young, his favorite holiday has been Halloween, and his favorite part is trick-or-treating with Mabel. He is also known to have been teased about his birthmark by other children until he started hiding it, which may be how he earned his nickname when he was no older than five.He also attended Eggbert Elementary with his sister.</p>
<h2>Mable Pines</h2>

<h2>Number one:Who she is</h2>
<p>Mabel Pines (born August 31,5 minutes before Dipper Pines) is a 12-year-old girl spending the summer with her Great Uncle Stan in Gravity Falls, Oregon, where she and her brother frequently encounter the supernatural. She takes a much less serious approach to life than her twin brother, as she navigates her way around odd, new surroundings. Mabel is represented by the Shooting Star in the Zodiac.The voice actor who plays her is Kristen Schaal and her inspiration was the creator's sister,Ariel Hirsch.</p>
<h2>Number two:Her physical apperance</h2>
<p>Mabel is a short girl who is exactly one millimeter taller than her twin brother.
Mabel's clothing varies for each episode, more so than any other character's, with at least one new outfit usually consisting of a sweater, undershirt, skirt, headband, black ballerina flats, white anklet socks, and occasionally earrings, though she does deviate from this look occasionally. Her signature outfit is a short-sleeved pink undershirt underneath a slightly darker fuschia sweater with a shooting star, accompanied by a purple, teal and orange-striped tail falling toward the left, a matching fuschia headband, a loose purple pencil skirt, coupled with black ballerina flats and white socks.
When playing mini-golf, Mabel wears a pink polo shirt with a purple skirt.
For her nightwear, she has a purple long-sleeve shirt-dress with a floppy disk in the middle, matching purple headband and dark pink socks.
Her swimsuit is a red one-piece swimsuit with a red star in the middle, as well as a matching red headband.

</p>
<h2>Number three:Her personality</h2>
<p>Mabel is an energetic, fun, bouncy, hyperactive, enthusiastic and free-spirited girl. She is an optimist who skips through life with a braces-filled smile and an assortment of extremely colorful knit sweaters. It is Mabel's outgoing personality and fearless curiosity that comes in handy when Dipper needs help solving a mystery, even if she isn't always aware of her silliness.She shows a more sophisticated attitude when it comes to art.<br>

Despite all the weirdness in Gravity Falls, Mabel is always a "glass-half-full" kind of girl.She is rarely angry or upset, and generally keeps a positive outlook. Despite her cheerful attitude, Mabel is shown to be quite sensitive, as she can occasionally get her feelings hurt, especially by her rival, Pacifica Northwest.She is a bit naive sometimes
.She avoids lying and is a terrible liar, often blurting out whatever it is about which she is trying to lie.<br>

Mabel is aware of her charm and cherishes her cuteness and beauty.She generally has a high opinion of herself, considering herself "irresistible" to boys, claiming that she does everything perfectly, and fully believing she is of "pure, perfect heart".<br>

Mabel has also on occasion made mistakes that accidentally backfire in some way, such as shoving her brother in a closet with Wendy in "Into the Bunker" so that he could end his anxiety and admit his crush on Wendy. This unintentionally endangers them when they encounter a dangerous creature. This also caused Wendy's friend group to temporarily break up after she had made Robbie Valentino and Tambry date each other in "The Love God." However, like her brother, Mabel has the best of intentions and she will always try to choose the right options for the happiness of herself and others, she also proves to be clumsy, as in the episode "Soos and the Real Girl," when Mabel was playing and suddenly collides with the front door of the Mystery Shack and gets a brace stuck on the metal door.</p>

<h2>Their relationship</h2>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1b/72/13/1b7213b66c17974144a30237a9ffebec.gif">
<p>Mabel and Dipper are very close and even call each other their best friends and the two enjoy spending time together, whether it's simply goofing off or having adventures in their strange summer home. The twins care deeply about each other and are easily willing to risk their lives for the sake of the other.Though they do sometimes bicker with each other, as siblings usually do.Mabel is secretly envious that her brother is better academically than she is (in contrast to Dipper, who is jealous of Mabel's social skills).Mabel cannot stand to see people bully Dipper,nor does Dipper like to see his sister upset,and he is somewhat protective over her.

They can get on each other's nerves at times, more frequently Mabel on Dipper's, due to teasing him. In "Gravity Falls: Don't Color This Book! It's Cursed!," a black light note in "Gravity Falls: Journal 3", and "Gravity Falls: Legend of the Gnome Gemulets", Mabel has made it clear that she's aware of Dipper's newfound friendship with Pacifica and frequently teases them about their hug in "Northwest Mansion Mystery". She's also shown to have an interest in making the two a couple since she writes, "Roses are red, Pacifica's blood is blue, I read what you crossed out, I'm onto you! Start combing your hair, brother!"

In "Not What He Seems", Dipper's relationship with Mabel is put to the test when she ignores his requests to press the red button. After Dipper lands on the floor when Stan's portal is activated, a picture of the two is seen when the glass framing gets broken, which might foreshadow a future obstacle in their relationship. In "A Tale of Two Stans", while Dipper holds no grudge towards her for trusting Stan, Mabel is left unsettled about their future due to Stan and Ford's strained relationship. In "Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons", Mabel's fear of her and Dipper developing a dysfunctional relationship is highlighted when he begins spending more time with Ford than her, pointing out that the latter doesn't make fun of him like she does, leaving Mabel upset and guilty over her past actions.

In "Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future", Mabel overhears Dipper accepting Ford's offer to become his apprentice and is so terrified and upset at the thought of her and Dipper not growing up together that she runs off crying into the forest. She does not wish to see summer end and have to leave Gravity Falls, leading to her inadvertently handing the portal's rift to Bill Cipher. However, in "Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality", Dipper convinces Mabel to leave her perfect prison bubble by promising her that he won't take Ford's apprenticeship and will always be there for her, having realized they can get through anything together, leading the twins to reconcile.</p>
