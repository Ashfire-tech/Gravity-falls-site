<h2 id="Who_he_is">Number One:Who he is</h2>
<p>Jesus "Soos" Alzamirano Ramírez(born July 13, 1990) is an employee and current ownerof the Mystery Shack. He was born in Gravity Falls, Oregon. He is 22 year old and is a generally fun dude who works at the Mystery Shack. Dipper and Mabel Pines sometimes include Soos in their adventures. He is the Question Mark on The Zodiac and his voice actor is Alex Hirsch.</p>
<h2 id="what_he_looks_like">Number Two:His physical apperance</h2>
<p>He's 6'0" tall, is stocky, and wears dark brown shoes, beige shorts and a jade green-ish gray shirt with a big dark green poorly painted question mark on the front and the word "Staff" on the back, which is from the Mystery Shack. He also owns one other shirt that looks just like his trademark shirt, only without the word "staff" or a question mark. He also has a double chin and has a few hairs on his face that he glues on himself. He has short light brown hair that is styled similar to Dipper's, which is shown in "Little Dipper." His neck is wider than his head, or so it appears. It seems to be obscured by his double chin. In Journal 3, Ford describes Soos as looking like a creature from a dimension he once visited. According to Dipper, Soos has a gentle blush on his cheeks; "Like a angel embarrassed by humanity".
For nightwear, he only sleeps in his underwear as revealed in the episode "Gideon Rises".</p>
<br>
<h2 id="His_personality">Number Three:His personality</h2>
<p>Soos is a fat, friendly, and buck-tooth employee whose desire to be where the action is makes him an excellent resource for the twins when they need a ride around town. Aside from the twins, he is one of the only people around who sees and believes all the strange things happening in Gravity Falls, as seen in "Tourist Trapped", when he says he is always noticing weird stuff in Gravity Falls, an assertion he makes in other episodes.
While he frequently shows an eager, inquisitive, and childish nature, Soos knows when to drop the act and be an adult, such as when he, Mabel, and Dipper encountered the Gobblewonker, where he carried both of them and outran it. He has good relationships with Dipper and Mabel, though Dipper becomes irritated with him at times, such as in "Land Before Swine", when he is clumsy and he does not see the problem. He is also very humorous. He is addicted to pressing the cackling skulls at the Summerween Superstore and believes that the inflatable ducks from the pool can talk. This gives proof of his childish and naïve nature.</p>
<h2 id="His_past">Number Four:His past</h2>
<p>Soos has worked at the Mystery Shack since he was twelve after Stan sacked Durland. After Dipper and Mabel leave a screwdriver from the Mystery Shack at his birthday party in "Blendin's Game," he goes to return it, where Stan Pines basically forces him into a job at the Shack. The Shack is very dear to him, and he never gets upset at Stan no matter what he does.<br>
It is stated he had a poor relationship with his father, seeing as how he would never visit Soos, even on his birthdays.
</p>
<h2 class="fun_facts">FUN FACTS!</h2>
<ol>

<h2 id="Who_she_is">Who she is</h2>
<p>Wendy Blerble Corduroy(born 1997)is a tall, laid-back teenager working a part-time job at the Mystery Shack.Fun-loving and rebellious, she often avoids responsibility for activities she finds much more fun, such as hanging out with her teenage friends or going on adventures with Dipper and Mabel Pines. Wendy represents the ice pack on the Zodiac, due to her coolness in the face of danger.
She is voiced by Linda Cardellini.</p>
<h2 id="what_she_looks_like">Her apperance</h2>
<p>At her current age of fifteen, Wendy is a very tall, attractive, and skinny teenager. She has green eyes,a fair complexion, and some freckles. She has long red hair just past her hips.
Wendy is usually seen wearing a tan and dark brown lumberjack hat, most likely because Manly Dan, her father, is a lumberjack. Her standard outfit is an emerald green plaid/flannel shirt with a white tank top underneath, green stub earrings, dark blue jeans, and muddy rain boots, with yellow and orange socks underneath. She also wears blue earrings and wears a name tag at work.<br>
In "Mabel's Guide to Color," Wendy is seen in a red flannel shirt instead of her regular jade flannel shirt.<br>
When Wendy was younger, she used to wear braces, pigtails, and a tucked in shirt. She was also really tall for her age, as revealed in "Double Dipper."<br>
In "A Tale of Two Stans" and "The Last Mabelcorn," Wendy is shown wearing a black tank top with a wolf on it instead of her regular white tank top under her flannel shirt. In "The Last Mabelcorn," she wears gray shorts with torn cuffs along with the wolf top, with her flannel shirt tied around her waist.<br>
In "Weirdmageddon Part 1," Wendy wears a ragged white tank top with her flannel shirt tied around her waist, a strip of flannel fabric tied around her head, finger-less black gloves, and two black stripes painted under her eyes.</p>
<h2 id="Her_personality">Her personality</h2>
<p>Wendy is a mellow, down-to-earth, fun-loving teen who is a part-time worker at the Mystery Shack. She doesn't enjoy working, despite the fact that she doesn't do anything at all while "working." Her boyish personality and interests reflect that of a tomboy. Despite her cool attitude, her attitude is largely a cover for the stress her family causes her.<br>
Wendy generally maintains a positive outlook, is almost always friendly, and is rarely seen being moody or cranky. She is friendly and generous to Dipper and Mabel even though they are younger than she is; even when Robbie teased her in "The Inconveniencing," she is always delighted to hang out with them. Wendy is a brave, strong girl when going against threats and protecting her friends. Through any adventure she goes on with her friends, she is always there to be helpful and very understanding.<br>
Wendy is just like any other ordinary teenager who wants to be an adult. She has been in numerous relationships with boys such as Rus Thorum, Eli Hall, Stoney Davidson, Mike Hurley, Nate Holt, an unnamed guy with tattoos, Danny Felman, Mark Epstein (who she forgot to break up with),and Robbie Valentino (who she broke up with in "Boyz Crazy").</p>
